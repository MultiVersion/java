# MultiVersion | Java

## What is this?
MultiVersion was created to run your minecraft server without using a lot of resources we use alpine and few other things to make it use less resources and make better for everyone.

## Features
- Docker/Containers
- Made with Alpine
- Java 8 & Java16 in same image
- LTS Releases

## Why use us?
We provide a better resource management in comparation of other eggs in resources like storage and ram we try use less resources as possible to make the final user have the best experience!

## Can we compare MultiVersion vs Some MultiEgg?
Yes we can if you are just a user you don't see any change unless on server startup but if you are a host owner probably yes, MultiVersion has Java 8 and Java 16 inside one image! What that means? It's simple! If we have One server with MultiVersion and other with some MultiEgg with Java 8 or Java 16 MultiVersion image will be bigger in storage but if we make 5 servers with MultiVersion and 5 with some MultiEgg we can see MultiVersion will use less resources! Why? MultiVersion as i said has Java 8 and Java 16 in same image but MultiEgg not, they get the java per server, Okay but what this changes? Since MultiVersion has Java 8 and Java16 images in one Docker image we don't need to download it per user giving user more storage, also without giving a bloated startup with many options while the final user will just use one!
